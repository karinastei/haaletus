# haaletus 

School work where the goal was to make a voting system where 11 people can vote and the voting time is limited by 5 minutes. If the voting was still happening people could also change their votes. Votes went into table HAALETUS, every vote and vote change went to table LOGI (inserts were made with SQL triggers) and final results went into table TULEMUSED (inserts were made with SQL triggers). The results and people who had voted were displayed on the voting page.
