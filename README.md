# haaletus 

School work where the goal was to make a voting system where 11 people can vote and the voting time is limited by 5 minutes. People can also change their votes if they vote again while the voting is ongoing. Votes go into table HAALETUS, every vote and vote change go to table LOGI (inserts were made with SQL triggers) and final results go into table TULEMUSED (inserts made with triggers). The results and people who had voted are displayed on the voting page. The database export file is also included (steinbergkarina_voting.sql).
